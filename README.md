# Vesicle Shrinking and Enlargement Play Opposing Roles in the Release of Exocytotic Contents

Authors: Rui Su, Zachary Mcdargh, Sathish Thiyagarajan, Ben O'Shaughnessy

Here we provided codes for calculating vesicle shape evolution during exocytosis under a squeezing osmotic pressure. We predicted three classes of vesicle shapes: lambda, omega, and tubular, all of which have been verified experimentally using STED super resolution microscopy by our collaborator, the Ling-gang Wu group at NIH. To learn more about our work, please read our paper.
